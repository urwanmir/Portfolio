## What is this?
It's my immersive dashboard generator. I'm currently mastering the foundations of Web Development, with a clear vision to shift into Web3 Security & Development (S&D). This tool generates actual UI artifacts that represent my evolving professional identity.

## Tech Stack
- **React 19**: Powers the UI logic and immersive background.
- **Gemini API**: The intelligence engine creating high-fidelity portfolio components.
- **Tailwind-style CSS**: All my artifacts are generated as clean, responsive HTML.

## How I use it
I type in my specific goals (e.g., "Web Dev foundations" or "Web3 S&D transition") and the engine designs 3 different professional directions for my portfolio.
